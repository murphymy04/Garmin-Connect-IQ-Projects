This is a repo to hold apps I've developed for Garmin's Connect IQ ecosystem.

## Metronome App
Basic metronome app for most modern Garmin watches that will vibrate at the specified beats per minute (bpm).
Supports non-touch screen Garmin devices as well, bpm can be adjusted using the "up" and "down" buttons on those devices.

Also includes a settings page where vibration strength and vibration pulse length can be updated.
